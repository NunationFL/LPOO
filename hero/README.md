Obligatory part finished but stuff to do later:

    Organize the code into packages.
    The hero could have some energy that would be drained as he touches monsters instead of dying immediately.
    There could be more types of monsters with different moving techniques.
    The map of the arena could be stored in a file and read when the game starts.
    Have different rooms each with its own map, number of coins, number of monsters and doors to go from one room to the other.
    Doors could only show after all coins have been collected.
    Keep the playerâ€™s score.
    Show messages in the game screen when the player loses or beats the game.
    Allow the player to restart the game after losing.
